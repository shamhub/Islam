Any action that goes against Sharia, is considered a Sin (Gunah)


There are 10 ways for repentance:

1)Istighfar
============

 Surah-Nuh verse 10 - 12 says:

 ![71:10](https://github.com/shamhub/islam/blob/main/repentance/image.png?raw=true)

          And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.


 ![71:11](https://github.com/shamhub/islam/blob/main/repentance/image-1.png?raw=true)

          He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers


 ![71:12](https://github.com/shamhub/islam/blob/main/repentance/image-2.png?raw=true)

          And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.


 Recite أسْتَغْفِرُ اللهَ رَبي مِنْ كُلِ ذَنبٍ وَأتُوبُ إلَيهِ

 **Transliteration**: Astaghfirullah rabbi min kulli zambiyon wa atoobu ilaiyh

 **Translation**: I ask forgiveness of my sins from Allah who is my Lord and I turn towards Him.


2)Tawbah
=========

 Surah Al-Imran says:

 ![3:135](https://github.com/shamhub/islam/blob/main/repentance/image-3.png?raw=true)


     And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah ? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.

 *Difference between Tawbah & Istighfar*:
 **Istighfar** is an act that must be done continuously in a Muslim’s life, and this is the main difference between Istighfar and Tawbah, The Muslim has to make Istighfar whether he sinned or not because sometimes the Muslim sins without knowing that he sinned and sometimes he forgets about his previous sins, so Istighfar is considered the Muslim’s weapon against the devil (Al Shaytan) who tries to drag the Son Of Man to hell by making him forgets his sins to accumulate over his shoulders, Also Istighfar opens the door of Allah’s continuous blessings, forgiveness and saves him from devil’s whispering.

 **Tawbah** is Repentance to Allah after committing a sin regardless of the kind of that sin and how great it is, asking for Allah’s forgiveness and mercy.
    Allah legislated Tawbah and made it obligatory for every Muslim who believes in Allah at any time and at every time.


3)Hasanat
=========
 hasanat (plural hasanat or hasanats) Credit for good deeds, which Allah weighs up against one's bad deeds at the final judgement after death.
 This is a cleansing act where, good deed acts as a soap and bad deed is dirt
