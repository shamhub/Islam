Translation:
Allah is the Guardian of the believers—He brings them out of darkness and into light. 
As for the disbelievers, their guardians are false gods who lead them out of light and into darkness. 
It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever.

Leading out of light into darkness is called taghut
