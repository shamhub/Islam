Human organs need food(rice/wheat etc...)
Human soul also need food

There are many ways to provide food for soul:

1) Reading Quran and Listening Quran
2) Istighfar (Arabic: ٱسْتِغْفَار ʾistiġfār), is the act of seeking forgiveness from Allah, by saying: 
        Astaghfirullah Rabbi Min Kulli Zambiyon Wa Atoobu Ilaiyh
        translation:
        I ask forgiveness of my sins from ALLAH who is my Lord and I turn towards HIM.
    100 times in the morning or 100 times in the evening, with sincerety
    Istighfar becomes mandatory, when a sin is performed
3) Read Durood Sharif
    Durood Sharif extinguish zulm from heart faster than water extinguish fire
4) Allah ka Zikr
    Remember Allah being alone
    Act of Zikr is to remember and value the mightyness of God
5) Ittaba e Sunnah
6) Companionship with Ulema(muslim scholars) 
7) Taqwah - Abstain from Sin activity
