About soul

Every human body has a soul

Unique property of a soul,  Soul doesn't stay in a dimension of time and space

This is why, dreams let us travel to our past and future. Behind the scenes, Soul travel in past & future

So, if there is no dimension of time, for soul, then there is no concept of distance travelled.

Soul already has the knowledge that Allah has provided our prophets
It is our wrong doing that makes Soul get layered under multiple covers.
