    There are two levels of Imaan
    > Reading kalma to become a Muslim, legally
        لا إله إلا الله  meaning any event happening is controlled by Allah
        Example: 
            Eyes cannot see on its own, Allah throws optic vision
            Ears cannot hear on it own, Allah throws the listening ability
            Food is not provided by farmer, Allah provides food
        With this first level of Imaan, you get all the legal rights(in real world) that any Muslim has.
        Every practicing Muslim & non-practicing muslim has equal rights legally, in real world 
    
    > Conviction of Islam in heart is second level of Imaan
