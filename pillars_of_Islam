    Ilm comes fom Hidayah(wahi of Prophet)
    Ilm comes from Akl of human
    Accepting them is Imaan
    Ex: Accepting that there is death, Accepting Prophet Muhammad is last Prophet etc...

    There are two levels of Imaan
    1) Reading kalma to become a Muslim, legally
        With first level, you get all the legal rights(in real world) that any Muslim has.
        Every practicing Muslim & non-practicing muslim has equal rights legally, in real world 
    2) Conviction of Islam in heart is second level
2) Prayer
3) Fasting
4) Zakaath
5) Hajj
