    There are two levels of Imaan
    > Reading kalma to become a Muslim, legally
        With first level, you get all the legal rights(in real world) that any Muslim has.
        Every practicing Muslim & non-practicing muslim has equal rights legally, in real world 
    > Conviction of Islam in heart is second level
