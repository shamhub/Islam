Objective mindset is encouraged rather than subjective mindset.
It does not mean life with objective mindset is devoid of emotion & empathy
Right balance of emotion is important, otherwise emotion degrades problem(in life or otherwise) solving skills

Example:
1) On a dinner table, if the food is not tasty, a 14 year old would find an alternative(and forget) unlike a 40 year old who complains about home maker.
2) Addressing poverty by finding a root cause(and forget) is diffrent from helping people out of emotion
