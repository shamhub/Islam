Hadith Qudsi

“ O Son of Adam! I desire something and you desire something but only what I desire occurs. If you submit yourself to my desire( i.e. obey Him), I will be sufficient for you in your desire. If you do not submit yourself to me (by disobeying Him), I will tire you in what you desire and (at the end of the day) only what I wish happens and occurs.” .

Another narration: Oh my slave, You want , and I want , but be certain, nothing will happen, unless I want. If you obey me in what I want, I will give you what you want. If you don’t obey me in what I want, I will make you struggle in what you want. But in the end, nothing will happen, except what I want.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Nothing can change the Divine decree except du’aa’. (Narrated by Ahmad, 5/277; Ibn Maajah, 90; al-Tirmidhi, 139. Classed as hasan(good & reliable) by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7687. See also al-Saheehah, 145).

No precaution can protect against the decree of Allaah. Du’aa’ is beneficial with regard to what has been decreed and what has not been decreed. The du’aa’ meets the calamity that has been decreed and wrestles with it, until the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by al-Tabaraani, 2/800 (33). Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7739, (it is) hasan).

Imam Shafi said, “A dua made at Tahajjud is like an arrow that never misses its target.”
