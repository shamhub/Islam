First lesson - secondary school student

In my opinion,
first lesson to teach a secondary school student is to introduce him about Creator.

If introduced in an elegant way, then, that should definitely trigger him to get an idea about his purpose of existence.

If he grasp this lesson properly, then, his five senses will be in Harmony, for rest of his life.

For example: he start observe things(surrounding) in a way he is supposed to.
