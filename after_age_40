Question

Is this Hadith correct and what is the correct meaning?

Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (radiyallahu ‘anhu) reports that Rasulullah (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:

“Allah has left no excuse for a man whose time of death is deferred until he reaches the age of sixty.”


 

Answer

 

Authenticity

Imam Bukhari (rahimahullah) has recorded this Hadith in his Sahih. The Hadith is therefore authentic.

(Sahih Bukhari, Hadith: 6419)

 

Explanation

The average lifespan of this Ummah is sixty to seventy years as recorded by Imam Tirmidhi (rahimahullah) on the authority of Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah (radiyallahu ‘anhu).

The commentators of Hadith explain that When a person reaches sixty, Allah has given him enough opportunity and lifespan to obey him and carry out good deeds. Once he reaches sixty, Allah will not accept any excuses from him for his failure to repent and carry out good deeds.

Therefore once a person reaches sixty it is highly recommended that he engages in abundant istighfar and turn his full focus toward the Hereafter.

(Refer: Fathul Bari, ‘Umdatul Qari, under Hadith: 6419 and Faydul Qadir, Hadith: 1148)

 

Note: Allah Ta’ala, through His divine wisdom may choose to forgive whomsoever he wishes. Therefore this Hadith does not mean that if a person reaches sixty and does not amend his ways there is no hope for him. It is never too late to repent. Perhaps Allah may afford him the opportunity to sincerely repent just before his dying moments.

 

 

And Allah Ta’ala Knows best.
